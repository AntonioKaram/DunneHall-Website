        <h4>Rev. Eric Schimmel, C.S.C.</h4>
        <p>Fr. Eric Schimmel, C.S.C., is a Holy Cross priest and the youngest of four children from Pittsburgh, 
            Pennsylvania. He first encountered the Congregation of Holy Cross while studying at the University of 
            Notre Dame where he earned his bachelor’s degree in chemistry and theology. Immediately following graduation, 
            he entered Moreau Seminary and eventually lived and worked in East Africa before finishing his master of divinity 
            degree at Notre Dame. He professed perpetual vows in 2001 and was ordained a priest in 2002. Fr. Eric served in parishes in 
            Colorado Springs, Colorado; South Bend, Indiana; Phoenix, Arizona; and Easton, Massachusetts. He spent several years as the 
            Director of Andre House, a ministry serving the poor and homeless in downtown Phoenix, in addition to three years in ministry at 
            King’s College in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania, working both in the Hispanic Outreach office and Campus Ministry. </p>
        <p>Throughout his varied ministry experiences, Fr. Eric has enjoyed helping young people discover their talents and develop them, 
            especially to help others. He feels blessed to be the rector of Dunne, the best hall on campus. 
            In his spare time, Fr. Eric has been known to hike, swim, and show his minimal skills on the basketball court. </p>

    <div class="row"><div class="col-md-9">
        <h4>Rev. Kevin Grove, C.S.C.</h4>
        <p> Fr. Kevin loves the outdoors, sports, farming, literature, and the occasional opportunity to do some woodworking. 
            On account of these loves and his upbringing, he confesses—and Dunne Sentinels attest—he is probably the worst video game 
            player in the world. Fr. Kevin was born and raised on a family farm and ranch outside of Hobson, Montana and was ordained a Holy 
            Cross priest in 2010. He completed his PhD in Philosophical Theology at the University of Cambridge, England. He specializes on memory, 
            how we know God, and the difference that Christ and the sacraments make unto that end. He is an assistant professor in the theology 
            department at Notre Dame, so you can enroll in one of his classes for foundations of theology starting in your first year. 
            Upperclassmen occasionally find their way into his sacraments class. Fr. Kevin hosts Sentinels after every 
            Tuesday evening Mass for food and conversation. </p>

        <h4>Ziggi</h4>
        <p> Ziggi is a black and silver mini Schnauzer. She’s hypoallergenic, and 
            (as you can tell from her profile pic) loves to break social-distancing rules! Ziggi is full-grown at about 14 pounds. 
            She loves to play fetch with tennis balls, disposable water bottles, and anything with a squeaker in it. She loves living in 
            Dunne Hall and the 200 best friends she has here! She really does get to know her Sents, and if she sees (smells?) you out and about 
            on campus she will definitely want to come say hello. Ziggi is a big sweetheart but also can be a little timid in the hallways of Dunne 
            (you can be so big and scary sometimes!). We are trying to help her work through this fear. So if you see her cowering as you’re coming 
            towards her, the best way to warm her up is to stop where you are, squat down like a baseball catcher, and talk sweetly to her. 
            She’ll come to you, slowly -- just be patient.
            Ziggi was featured in a ND Magazine article during the COVID year; you can read more about her and some of the other campus pets 
            <a href="https://magazine.nd.edu/special-features/reigning-cats-and-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Feel free to 
            follow her on Instagram as well <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ziggi.schnauzer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ziggi.schnauzer</a>!
